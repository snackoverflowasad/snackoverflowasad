### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **[Asad Hussain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asad-hussain-765502319/)**, a developer based in India.
I love building clean, functional apps from frontend UI to backend logic.
If I get an idea, I usually build it, break it, fix it, and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion and GSAP**.  
My favorite tools are **VS Code, Git, GitHub, and Vercel**.

Recent projects include my **[Portfolio Website](https://www.asadhussain.in/)**, a **[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/Asad-bot07/Multi-Agent-System-II)** focused on collaborative AI workflows, and a **[JWT-based Authentication System](https://github.com/Asad-bot07/JWT-Auth)** implementing secure, scalable authorization. I also work on modern UI animations using Motion and GSAP, applied in real-world projects such as the **[MetaSphere 2026](https://metasphere2026.iem.edu.in/)** event website.

You can reach me **[here](mailto:techie.asad.dev@gmail.com)** anytime.

#### Fun Facts:

- I build small projects when I’m bored and by small, I mean fun, brain-rot ideas like **[Grimtok](https://grim-tok.vercel.app/)**
- I’m lazy in the best way like it pushes me to build smarter solutions that make work faster, simpler, and more efficient, like a **[WhatsApp bot](https://github.com/Asad-bot07/BotWithHaki)** that replies, sets reminders, and schedules meetings on my behalf.
- Coding + music = perfect combo
- **Hobbies:** Coding and Gaming
